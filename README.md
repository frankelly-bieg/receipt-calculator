# Receipt Calculator

This is a replica of a basic billing system, in which we will calculate the price of a product + the taxes to be collected.
We will apply two taxes:

- Basic Sales taxes (10%)
- Import Duty (5%, when applicable)

Regarding basic sales taxes, the following types of products will be exempt from them:

- Food
- Books
- Medical products
